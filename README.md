# HandSignalProject
Nvidia Deel Learning Institute Final Project for Certificate
Hi guys,
This program is designed to help divers communicate with a machine that can do certain things.
It is meant to act as an autonomous toolbox that can move up, down, and produce a hammer or a screwdriver, as well as send a signal to call for another diver.
It obviously does not work perfectly, but it can generally identify the 5 different hand positions without any issues.
Thanks.
